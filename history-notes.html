On Westward/ Westward Expansion part 2
—---------------------------------

Mexico Before the Texas Revolution.
—--------------------
After independence from Spain in 1821 Mexico struggled to defend northern regions.
Comanche raids, which existed prior to independence became harder to control because the new government lacked money, soldiers, and stability
Northern Mexico was far from Mexico city.
Because of distance the local government made decisions without help from the national government.

Comanche Empire
—-----------------
From 1821 to 1849 the comanche launched raids into Mexico.
They wanted resources to trade.
Many Mexicans would flee homes because of them
The U.S. believed this was proof of their superiority and Mexico believed the U.S. funded them

Mexico after independence
—-------------------
They face many changes in leadership
Military leaders often removed presidents which made it difficult to enforce laws.
To help stabilize Tejas (texas) they invited settlers on the condition that they had to follow their laws and convert to catholicism.

General and president Santa Anna
—------------------------------
Elected in 1833 and initially allowed others to govern with him behind the scenes
He slowly puts supporters in places of power
In 1835 with the backing of the army, clergy, and the noble he dissolved Mexico's congress
He made Mexico have a centralized government making him a dictator
Rebellions formed to restore the old republic but are suppressed with the military.

Texas revolution and independence
—------------------------------
American settlers in Texas were angry because Mexico banned slaves. Mexico abolished slaves in 1829
Many Tejanos were also upset that Santa Anna became a dictator and broke the promise in the constitution
Across Mexico rebellions began
Although Mexico won the battle of Alamo it became  a symbol that motivated Texans to fight.
In the battle of San Jacinto the Texans beat the Mexicans and said to remember the Alamo.
After Santa Anna was captured he was forced to sign a treaty and it made Texas start acting independent.
10 years later Texas joins the U.S.
